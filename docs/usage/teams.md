A team is a collection of models used to provide organizational or contextual grouping (ex., department, project, tenant).

By default, created teams are active and not granted by default. 'Active' means the team is actively granting access, and 'not granted by default' means a model must be explicitly assigned to teams.

A modelâ€™s effective teams are the union of its teams granted by default and direct teams, excluding the teams directly denied from the model. Keep in mind, a model will effectively be on no teams (granted by default or direct) if the model is not using the `HasTeams` trait.

Gatekeeper exposes a variety of team-related methods through its facade and `HasTeams` trait. This section documents each of them with accompanying code examples.

<a name="team-entities"></a>
## Team Entities

The following methods deal with managing team entities themselves.

<a name="check-team-existence"></a>
### Check Team Existence

You may check whether a team exists in the database, regardless of its active or inactive status.

The `teamExists` method accepts a string or a string-backed enum.

**Returns:** `bool`

```php
use Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Facades\Gatekeeper;

$exists = Gatekeeper::teamExists('support');

// or using an enum...

enum Team: string {
    case Support = 'support';
}

$exists = Gatekeeper::teamExists(Team::Support);
```

<a name="create-team"></a>
### Create Team

You may create a new team, which will be active by default.

If the team already exists, a `TeamAlreadyExistsException` will be thrown.

The `createTeam` method accepts a string or a string-backed enum.

**Returns:** `\Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Packets\Entities\Team\TeamPacket`

```php
use Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Facades\Gatekeeper;

$team = Gatekeeper::createTeam('management');

// or using an enum...

enum Team: string {
    case Management = 'management';
}

$team = Gatekeeper::createTeam(Team::Management);
```

<a name="update-team-name"></a>
### Update Team Name

You may update the name of an existing team.

The `updateTeamName` method accepts a `TeamPacket` instance, a string, or a string-backed enum as the first argument (the existing team), and a string or string-backed enum as the second argument (the new name).

If the team does not exist, a `TeamNotFoundException` will be thrown.

If a team with the new name already exists, a `TeamAlreadyExistsException` will be thrown.

**Returns:** `\Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Packets\Entities\Team\TeamPacket`

```php
use Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Facades\Gatekeeper;

$updatedTeam = Gatekeeper::updateTeamName('management', 'engineering');

// or using enums...

enum Team: string {
    case Management = 'management';
    case Engineering = 'engineering';
}

$updatedTeam = Gatekeeper::updateTeamName(Team::Management, Team::Engineering);
```

<a name="grant-team-by-default"></a>
### Grant Team by Default

You may want a team that most, if not all, models should be on by default. Granting the team by default effectively assigns all models to it, if the models are not denying it.

The `grantTeamByDefault` method accepts a `TeamPacket` instance, a string, or a string-backed enum.

If the team does not exist, a `TeamNotFoundException` will be thrown.

If the team is already granted by default, it will simply be returned without raising an exception.

**Returns:** `\Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Packets\Entities\Team\TeamPacket`

```php
use Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Facades\Gatekeeper;

$grantedByDefaultTeam = Gatekeeper::grantTeamByDefault('support');

// or using an enum...

enum Team: string {
    case Support = 'support';
}

$grantedByDefaultTeam = Gatekeeper::grantTeamByDefault(Team::DeleteUsers);
```

<a name="revoke-team-default-grant"></a>
### Revoke Team Default Grant

You may decide that a team should not be [granted by default](#grant-team-by-default). You can easily revoke a team's default grant.

The `revokeTeamDefaultGrant` method accepts a `TeamPacket` instance, a string, or a string-backed enum.

If the team does not exist, a `TeamNotFoundException` will be thrown.

If the team is not granted by default, it will simply be returned without raising an exception.

**Returns:** `\Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Packets\Entities\Team\TeamPacket`

```php
use Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Facades\Gatekeeper;

$nonGrantedByDefaultTeam = Gatekeeper::revokeTeamDefaultGrant('support');

// or using an enum...

enum Team: string {
    case Support = 'support';
}

$nonGrantedByDefaultTeam = Gatekeeper::revokeTeamDefaultGrant(Team::DeleteUsers);
```

<a name="deactivate-team"></a>
### Deactivate Team

You may temporarily deactivate a team if you want it to stop granting access without unassigning it from models.

Deactivated teams remain in the database but are ignored by team checks until reactivated. The roles and permissions attached to teams will also be ignored until the team is reactivated.

The `deactivateTeam` method accepts a `TeamPacket` instance, a string, or a string-backed enum.

If the team does not exist, a `TeamNotFoundException` will be thrown.

If the team is already inactive, it will simply be returned without raising an exception.

**Returns:** `\Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Packets\Entities\Team\TeamPacket`

```php
use Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Facades\Gatekeeper;

$deactivatedTeam = Gatekeeper::deactivateTeam('finance');

// or using an enum...

enum Team: string {
    case Finance = 'finance';
}

$deactivatedTeam = Gatekeeper::deactivateTeam(Team::Finance);
```

<a name="reactivate-team"></a>
### Reactivate Team

You may reactivate an inactive team to resume granting access to models.

The `reactivateTeam` method accepts a `TeamPacket` instance, a string, or a string-backed enum.

If the team does not exist, a `TeamNotFoundException` will be thrown.

If the team is already active, it will simply be returned without raising an exception.

**Returns:** `\Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Packets\Entities\Team\TeamPacket`

```php
use Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Facades\Gatekeeper;

$reactivatedTeam = Gatekeeper::reactivateTeam('support');

// or using an enum...

enum Team: string {
    case Support = 'support';
}

$reactivatedTeam = Gatekeeper::reactivateTeam(Team::Support);
```

<a name="delete-team"></a>
### Delete Team

You may delete a team to remove it from your application.

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting a team will remove it from your application and unassign it from all models.

The `deleteTeam` method accepts a `TeamPacket` instance, a string, or a string-backed enum.

If the team is already deleted, the method will return `true` without raising an exception.

**Returns:** `bool`

```php
use Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Facades\Gatekeeper;

$teamDeleted = Gatekeeper::deleteTeam('support');

// or using an enum...

enum Team: string {
    case Support = 'support';
}

$teamDeleted = Gatekeeper::deleteTeam(Team::Support);
```

<a name="find-team-by-name"></a>
### Find Team by Name

You may retrieve a team by its name. If the team does not exist, `null` will be returned.

The `findTeamByName` method accepts a string or a string-backed enum.

**Returns:** `\Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Packets\Entities\Team\TeamPacket|null`

```php
use Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Facades\Gatekeeper;

$team = Gatekeeper::findTeamByName('support');

// or using an enum...

enum Team: string {
    case Support = 'support';
}

$team = Gatekeeper::findTeamByName(Team::Support);
```

<a name="get-all-teams"></a>
### Get All Teams

You may retrieve a collection of all teams defined in your application, regardless of their active status.

The `getAllTeams` method does not take any arguments.

**Returns:** `\Illuminate\Support\Collection<string, \Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Packets\Entities\Team\TeamPacket>`

```php
use Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Facades\Gatekeeper;

$teams = Gatekeeper::getAllTeams();
```

<a name="model-team-relationships"></a>
## Model Team Relationships

The following methods allow you to assign, unassign, deny, undeny, and inspect teams for models.

> [!NOTE]
> Models passed to Gatekeeper must use the `\Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Traits\HasTeams` trait to enable the methods described below.

<a name="add-model-to-team"></a>
### Add Model To Team

You may add a model to a team using one of the following approaches:

- Using the static `Gatekeeper::addModelToTeam($model, $team)` method
- Using the fluent `Gatekeeper::for($model)->addToTeam($team)` chain
- Calling `$model->addToTeam($team)` directly (available via the `HasTeams` trait)

The `$team` argument must be a `TeamPacket` instance, a string, or a string-backed enum.

If the team does not exist, a `TeamNotFoundException` will be thrown.

If the team is denied from a model, the denial will be removed before assigning.

**Returns:** `bool` â€“ `true` if the model is on the team

```php
use Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Facades\Gatekeeper;

enum Team: string {
    case Support = 'support';
}

$user = User::query()->findOrFail(1);

$addedToTeam = Gatekeeper::addModelToTeam($user, Team::Support);

// or fluently...

$addedToTeam = Gatekeeper::for($user)->addToTeam(Team::Support);

// or via the trait method...

$addedToTeam = $user->addToTeam(Team::Support);
```

<a name="add-model-to-multiple-teams"></a>
### Add Model to Multiple Teams

You may add a model to multiple teams using one of the following approaches:

- Using the static `Gatekeeper::addModelToAllTeams($model, $teams)` method
- Using the fluent `Gatekeeper::for($model)->addToAllTeams($teams)` chain
- Calling `$model->addToAllTeams($teams)` directly (available via the `HasTeams` trait)

The `$teams` argument must be an array or Arrayable containing any combination `TeamPacket` instances, strings, or a string-backed enums.

If the model is already on a team, the team will be skipped without raising an exception.

If a team does not exist, a `TeamNotFoundException` will be thrown.

If a team is denied from a model, the denial will be removed before assigning.

> [!NOTE]
> This method stops on the first failure.

**Returns:** `bool` â€“ `true` if the model is on all the teams

```php
use Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Facades\Gatekeeper;

enum Team: string {
    case Management = 'management';
    case Engineering = 'engineering';
    case Support = 'support';
}

$teams = [Team::Management, Team::Engineering, Team::Support];

$user = User::query()->findOrFail(1);

$addedToTeams = Gatekeeper::addModelToAllTeams($user, $teams);

// or fluently...

$addedToTeams = Gatekeeper::for($user)->addToAllTeams($teams);

// or via the trait method...

```php
use Gillyware\Gatekeeper\Facades\Gatekeeper;

enum Team: string {
    case Support = 'support';
}

// or fluently...

$removedFromTeams = Gatekeeper::for($user)->removeFromAllTeams($teams);

// or via the trait method...

$removedFromTeams = $user->removeFromAllTeams($teams);
```

<a name="deny-team-from-model"></a>
### Deny Team from Model
