## Overview

Gatekeeper provides several Artisan commands to help manage permissions, roles, teams, and assignments through the command line. These commands offer an interactive interface for common tasks such as creating, assigning, and revoking entities.

<a name="gatekeeperlist"></a>
## `gatekeeper:list`

List all configured permissions, roles, and teams in your application.

This command displays the name, active status, and timestamps for each permission, role, or team, using your configured timezone.

### Usage

```bash
php artisan gatekeeper:list
```

By default, it will display all permissions, roles, and teams unless filtered with an option.

### Options

| Option          | Description           |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| `--permissions` | Only show permissions |
| `--roles`       | Only show roles       |
| `--teams`       | Only show teams       |

You can combine options to show only the specific types you want.

### Example

List only permissions:

```bash
php artisan gatekeeper:list --permissions
```

List only roles and teams (no permissions):

```bash
php artisan gatekeeper:list --roles --teams
```

<a name="gatekeeperclear-cache"></a>
## `gatekeeper:clear-cache`

Invalidate all Gatekeeper-related cache entries.

This command increments the internal cache version, effectively expiring all cache keys related to roles, permissions, and teams.

### Usage

```bash
php artisan gatekeeper:clear
```

### Behavior

- Increments an internal `cache.version` value used in all Gatekeeper cache keys.
- This forces all future queries to generate fresh results.
- Does not remove items from the cache store directlyâ€”just invalidates them.
