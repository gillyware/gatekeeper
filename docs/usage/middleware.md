Gatekeeper provides a set of route middleware aliases to enforce access control at the HTTP layer based on a modelâ€™s permissions, roles, or team memberships.

> [!NOTE]
> The access checking within these middleware relies on the authenticated user being accessible via `Auth::user()`.

## Usage in Routes

### Single Value

```php
Route::get('/dashboard', function () {
    // ...
})->middleware('has_permission:gatekeeper.view');
```

### Multiple Values

Pass multiple arguments by separating them with commas:

```php
Route::post('/posts', function () {
    // ...
})->middleware('has_any_permission:create-posts,edit-posts');
```

### Route Groups

You can apply middleware to groups:

```php
Route::middleware(['has_role:admin'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/admin', fn () => view('admin'));
});
```

## Handling Access Denials

If the user does not meet the middleware condition:
- If the request expects JSON, a 400 response is returned with a `{"message": "Access denied."}` payload.
- Otherwise, the request will abort with a `400 Bad Request` status and an "Access denied." message.
